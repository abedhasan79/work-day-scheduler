# Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day 
This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
clicking on the save button next to the text area allows user to save their input so it will stay even after refreshing the page.

This applicaion was made based on the following instrucitons:

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
- THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist
